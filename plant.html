      <h3 style="background-color:white;color=black;font-size=60pt;padding=10px;width=50%;font-weight=extrabold;margin:auto;text-align:justify;line-height:20pt"> Why Conserve Plants?
      </h3></br>
      <p style="background-color:white;color=black;font-size=40pt;padding=10px;width=50%;font-weight=extrabold;margin:auto;text-align:justify;line-height:20pt"> Humans and animals are dependent on plants for their survival.  Plants provide the food that we eat, our animal feed, the clothes we wear as well as the active ingredients for our medicines. In addition, living plants are essential to the healthy functioning of our biosphere – the living world which humans inhabit.  Plants synthesize oxygen and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

      <p style="background-color:white;color=black;font-size=40pt;padding=10px;width=50%;font-weight=extrabold;margin:auto;text-align:justify;line-height:20pt"> As well as providing food to eat, plants provide materials for our housing – wood, thatch, straw, wicker etc.  They provide materials that are essential to our lifestyle – rubber, paper, oils, wine, dyes and pigments.  Many modern pharmaceuticals are based on chemicals that are derived from plants.  In the developing world 80% of people rely on herbs, barks, fruits and roots of plants for their natural medicines.  Increasingly science is looking to biofuels as a future replacement to fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and gas.
