      <p style="background-color:white;color=black;font-size=40pt;padding=10px;width=50%;margin:auto;text-align:justify;line-height:20pt">An herbarium is a collection of dried plants or fungi used for scientific study. Herbaria are the main source of data for the field of botany called taxonomy. Plant taxonomists study the biodiversity of a particular region of the world (floristic research) or the relationships among members of a particular group of organisms (monographic research). Although a plant looks different when it is dried compared to when it is growing in nature, most of the key features needed for taxonomic studies can be found in a well-prepared herbarium specimen . These features include the size and shape of the various parts of the organism, as well as surface texture, cellular structure, and color reactions with certain chemical solutions. From the investigation of these features, the taxonomist prepares a detailed description of the organism, which can be compared to descriptions of other organisms. Today it is possible to extract genetic material (deoxyribonucleic acid; DNA) from herbarium specimens. Gene sequences provide many data points for comparison between organisms.
